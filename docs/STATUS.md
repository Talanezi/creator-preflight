# Project Status

## Current milestone

Milestone 14 — Grounded Claim Review.

Status: completed on 2026-09-03 after the controlled live Gemini scan extracted two factual claims from the real video, verified both in one Google Search-grounded request, preserved real provider citation metadata, emitted one cautious timestamped conflict finding, reused one upload across all AI tasks, and cleaned up the remote file.

- Human and JSON CLI output with documented exit codes 0, 1, and 2.
- Desktop-first React scan workflow with input, selected-file, named-stage processing, result, and runtime-error states.
- TypeScript models matching the current backend `PreflightReport`, `Finding`, `MediaInspection`, and check-result schemas.
- Typed NEEDS_REVIEW, READY, and BLOCKED mock reports kept outside UI components.
- Professional report workspace with verdict/count summary, media metadata, local browser video preview, check coverage, evidence-focused findings, and category filters.
- Proportional, timestamp-only findings timeline with hover/focus detail and shared click-to-seek behavior for markers and finding timecodes.
- Responsive desktop, laptop, and narrow stacked layouts with keyboard focus styling and reduced-motion handling.
- Reusable application/runtime error presentation that is visually and semantically separate from a successful BLOCKED scan.
- Light, neutral productivity-tool visual language with no gradients, glows, background grids, glass effects, or heavy shadows.
- Results hierarchy centered on the checked filename, compact verdict/count summary, dominant video review surface, attached timeline, and divider-based findings list.
- Technical media metadata consolidated into one supporting line; the primary check-coverage grid replaced by a native disclosure with simple outcome rows.
- Finding evidence moved behind per-finding disclosures while titles, explanations, suggestions, and clickable timecodes remain immediately scannable.
- New-scan form consolidated into one work surface with a direct page heading and no decorative workflow numbering or redundant micro-headings.
- Development mock-state selector removed from visible product chrome while remaining available to automated tests and visual QA.
- Focused typed frontend API client for the real `/api/v1/preflight/scan` multipart contract, including runtime response validation and safe structured error mapping.
- Normal product scanning now uploads the selected video, title, line-preserving description, and optional captions to FastAPI and renders only the returned `PreflightReport`.
- Honest indeterminate processing state with no simulated detector stages, completion marks, percentages, or automatic mock transition.
- AbortController cancellation and request sequencing prevent reset, retry, or later scans from rendering obsolete results or intentional-abort errors.
- Browser object-URL preview lifecycle retained with cleanup on replacement, reset, and unmount; real finding timecodes and timeline markers seek the selected local video.
- Vite development proxy routes `/api` to the local FastAPI server on `127.0.0.1:8000`.
- Content-based UTF-8 SRT and WebVTT parsing with BOM, CRLF/LF, multiline text, cue identifiers, hour timestamps, and ordinary WebVTT cue settings.
- Typed caption cues, structured parse issues, deterministic timing/order/range/overlap/empty-text/large-gap findings, and bounded caption file handling.
- Compact `caption_summary` report data with cue count, first/last cue times, merged covered duration, and timeline coverage capped at 100%.
- Caption checks integrated into the existing scanner, verdict, stable finding order, explicit check accounting, CLI, multipart API, TypeScript contract, category filters, timeline, and click-to-seek behavior.
- Opt-in `faster-whisper` dependency group with disabled-by-default configuration, lazy imports/model loading, process-local model reuse, CPU defaults, and automatic downloads disabled by default.
- Deterministic speech-versus-caption interval subtraction with boundary tolerance, adjacent-gap merging, minimum-duration filtering, and conservative `CAPTION_SPEECH_GAP` findings.
- Graceful structured review findings when optional speech recognition dependencies, models, or transcription execution are unavailable; deterministic caption and core media checks continue.
- Release audit corrected oversized-caption API behavior to match the shared scanner/CLI report path while retaining a bounded `maximum_file_size_bytes + 1` temporary copy.
- Malformed caption files with no usable cues now produce one coherent parse finding instead of redundant parse-plus-empty warnings; genuinely empty files still produce `CAPTION_EMPTY`.
- Detector timeouts now return structured HTTP 504 responses, consistent with bounded execution semantics.
- Configuration validation errors now identify the complete Creator Preflight configuration rather than misleadingly referring only to detector configuration.
- Frontend caption guidance now reflects real timing, structure, and coverage inspection.
- Removing or replacing selected browser files clears the native file input value, allowing the same file to be selected again; object-URL cleanup remains verified.
- Real optional `faster-whisper` transcription verified with the repository-defined `tiny.en` model on CPU/`int8`, using a temporary locally synthesized spoken-audio fixture and the existing production adapter.
- Real Whisper speech intervals verified through the existing caption-coverage comparison, producing a timestamped `CAPTION_SPEECH_GAP` for deliberately uncovered speech.
- Reusable deterministic demo-video generator shared by backend tests and the release workflow, preserving the known 2–5 second black, 3–6 second silence, 7–10 second non-black freeze, and audio-peak events.
- Tracked copyright-free demo package with one deliberately overlong title, one valid description, and four valid SRT cues covering the complete 12-second timeline without caption findings.
- One-command `scripts/run_demo.sh` workflow that generates the media and invokes the installed CLI with the tracked package and default YAML configuration.
- Root README rewritten around the verified product, reproducible quick start, CLI/web demo, local-first architecture, deterministic checks, caption parsing, and optional verified local Whisper behavior.
- Final judge-mode audit verified the README value proposition, installation commands, one-command demo, real browser workflow, cautious finding language, optional Whisper claims, and repository hygiene without requiring product or UI changes.
- Real browser demo verified the generated media, tracked title/description/SRT package, live FastAPI response, rendered counts/findings, proportional timeline, exact click-to-seek behavior, clean reset, and absence of mock controls or browser console issues.
- Default missing-description policy calibrated from a blocking error to a review warning while preserving the existing deterministic verdict rules and stricter configurable package requirements.
- Global audio-peak inspection calibrated to require both a decoded peak at or above the configured threshold and a configurable minimum density of samples in FFmpeg `volumedetect`'s top 1 dBFS histogram bin.
- Demo audio now includes a deliberately hard-limited interval so its audio warning demonstrates sustained near-full-scale sample density rather than a single maximum sample.
- Representative deterministic controls cover ordinary motion, low-motion talking-head-style footage, normal pauses over ambient signal, short black transitions, brief near-full-scale transients, and clean media without changing the established black, silence, or freeze defaults.
- Optional `google-genai` dependency group and isolated `creator_preflight.ai_review` provider boundary implemented against the maintained SDK's Files API, Generate Content API, and native structured-output schema support.
- Typed, bounded AI observation trust boundary validates approved objective observation types, text/evidence lengths, confidence, finite timestamp ranges, media-duration tolerance, and observation count before normalization.
- `PreflightScanner` remains the single orchestrator; enabled AI observations become review-only normalized findings, while disabled or unavailable AI cannot invoke or break deterministic scanning.
- Preflight report schema 1.1 adds safe AI provider/model/status/runtime/cleanup provenance without exposing an API key, remote file identifier, raw prompt, raw response, or provider traceback.
- Copyright-free 12-second Gemini smoke fixture generator creates three known four-second color, shape-position, and audio-tone states in a generated 640×360 video under 300 KB.
- Task-specific Promise Check trust boundary with inferred promise, first substantive delivery evidence/time, bounded delivery and thumbnail-alignment enums, confidence, and tightly enumerated issue observations.
- Transparent Promise policy: a delay warning begins only after 20 seconds; editorial issues require at least 0.70 confidence and specific evidence; all normalized AI findings remain review-only.
- Optional bounded PNG/JPEG thumbnail input is supported by the shared package model, CLI, FastAPI multipart endpoint, and frontend, with content validation, preview cleanup, and request-temporary storage only.
- Typed report schema 1.2 includes a compact Promise summary that distinguishes aligned, needs-review, unavailable, disabled, and not-evaluable outcomes without fabricating a score or finding.
- The React results view renders positive Promise evidence and address time; editorial findings use the existing filters, timeline, and click-to-seek behavior.
- Deterministic 36-second Promise fixture generator creates an unrelated 0–12 second creator intro, explicit blue-light/sleep content from 12 seconds onward, and an aligned 640×360 PNG thumbnail without tracking generated media.
- Task-specific Final Viewer Pass trust boundary supports only narration/visual conflict, visible placeholder, and conservatively evidenced accidental-repetition observations.
- One per-scan Gemini upload session now supports independent Promise and Viewer structured generation calls, task-failure isolation, and cleanup after both tasks.
- Typed report schema 1.3 adds a compact Viewer Pass summary distinguishing clean, needs-review, unavailable, disabled, and not-evaluable outcomes.
- Viewer findings require at least 0.75 confidence plus concrete evidence; narration conflicts additionally require spoken and visible evidence, and repetition requires both original and repeated intervals. All remain review-only.
- The React results view renders a restrained Viewer Pass summary and existing editorial findings/timeline/click-to-seek behavior without a separate AI interface.
- Local narrated 45-second clean and 48-second problematic Viewer fixtures isolate semantic review from deterministic black/silence/freeze/audio warnings.
- Optional, independently disabled Grounded Claim Review extracts at most three high-confidence public factual claims from the shared Gemini video upload and verifies them together in one text-only Google Search-grounded request.
- Claim Review trusts only provider grounding metadata for source links; model-authored URLs are excluded, missing attributable citations become insufficient evidence, and only sufficiently supported possible conflicts become timestamped review-only findings.
- Typed report schema 1.4 includes a compact Claim Review summary for disabled, no-claims, clean, needs-review, and unavailable outcomes; the frontend renders safe source links and uses existing timeline/click-to-seek behavior.
- A generated 36-second narrated control contains the supported Eiffel Tower 1889 claim, deliberately conflicting Apollo 11 1968 claim, and a subjective spacecraft opinion intended to be ignored.

## Not implemented

- Caption editing, transcript editing, or caption generation.
- Cloud transcription or speech APIs.
- Platform integrations, persistence, deployment, or account features.

## Blockers

None known.

## Known detector limitations

- Black frames are also static frames, so a sustained black section can legitimately produce both black and freeze findings.
- Audio peak inspection combines FFmpeg `volumedetect`'s global decoded maximum with the fraction of decoded samples in its top 1 dBFS histogram bin. It is stronger evidence of sustained near-full-scale audio than a lone maximum, but does not prove audible clipping or distortion, provide a timestamp, or certify loudness/compliance.
- Detectors analyze the first selected video or audio stream. Stream counts remain available from media inspection, but per-stream anomaly reports are not implemented.
- Each applicable detector uses a separate bounded FFmpeg pass. This is reliable and fast for short demo media but intentionally not optimized into a combined filter graph.
- Static shots, title cards, still images, intentional silence, and intentional dark sections can produce review warnings; findings are evidence for review, not claims of definite corruption.
- SRT/WebVTT parsing intentionally covers QA-relevant timing and text extraction, not every browser rendering, styling, region, or positioning feature.
- Timeline coverage measures time inside at least one caption cue; without optional speech recognition it does not establish spoken-word coverage.
- Long cue gaps, cue overlaps, and detected speech gaps are review evidence rather than proof of an error. Music, silence, intentional visuals, multiple speakers, and Whisper segmentation can produce legitimate intervals.
- Speech/caption comparison depends on approximate local Whisper segments and uses configurable tolerance; it does not compare transcript strings or certify caption accuracy.
- Caption uploads are limited to 5,000,000 bytes by default and must be UTF-8 text.
- Chapter parsing recognizes only lines beginning with `MM:SS` or `H:MM:SS` followed by a name. Inline times and ordinary numbers are intentionally ignored.
- URL validation reports only obvious syntax errors in HTTP(S)/`www.`-style tokens. It does not resolve, request, classify, or establish the safety of a URL.
- CLI exit code 1 represents a completed scan with either `NEEDS_REVIEW` or `BLOCKED`; it is not a runtime crash.
- Gemini review is optional cloud processing: when enabled, the selected video leaves the local Creator Preflight instance and is sent to Google. Provider observations are probabilistic review evidence, not deterministic truth.
- Promise Check is probabilistic editorial evidence. It does not predict retention/virality, fact-check claims, generate package assets, or perform a generic final-viewer review.
- Final Viewer Pass is probabilistic internal-consistency evidence. It does not fact-check, identify which conflicting value is true, certify an error-free video, or provide generic creative criticism. Accidental repetition is inherently less reliable than explicit text/audio conflicts.
- Claim Review checks only a few selected public claims and depends on Google Search coverage and citation attribution. It does not certify the whole video, search private facts, or treat missing/ambiguous evidence as support.
- The adapter attempts explicit remote deletion, but provider cleanup failure cannot override a successful review; Gemini Files API uploads otherwise have the provider's temporary retention lifecycle.

## Known frontend limitations

- Analysis uses one non-streaming request, so the processing view is intentionally indeterminate and cannot identify the currently running backend detector.
- No demo video is bundled. Click-to-seek depends on the browser being able to preview the selected media codec/container; report timestamps still render when preview playback is unavailable.
- Timeline filtering is category-based only. Severity filtering and richer overlap lanes are intentionally deferred.

## Known demo limitations

- The primary demo audio is deterministic synthetic tone and silence rather than speech. Its SRT demonstrates real caption parsing and coverage validation, not semantic transcript accuracy. Optional local Whisper is verified separately and remains unnecessary for the primary demo.

## Validation

- `.venv/bin/python -m pip install './backend[dev]'` — succeeded and installed the `creator-preflight` console entry point.
- Targeted Milestone 3 configuration/rules/report/CLI/API run — 42 passed, 0 failed, 1 upstream Starlette TestClient deprecation warning.
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests` — 69 passed, 0 failed, 1 upstream Starlette TestClient deprecation warning. All Milestone 1 and 2 tests remain included and passing.
- Fresh deterministic fixtures generated through `backend/tests/conftest.py`: a 12-second anomaly fixture and a one-second clean control — succeeded.
- Direct unified `PreflightScanner` smoke scan with a deliberate title-length warning — `NEEDS_REVIEW`; 14 checks run, 9 passed, 5 warnings, 0 critical; measured runtime approximately 0.159 seconds.
- Unified anomaly intervals: black expected 2.0–5.0 → detected 2.0–5.0; silence expected 3.0–6.0 → detected 3.0–6.000021; non-black freeze expected 7.0–10.0 → detected 7.0–10.0.
- The redundant freeze at black 2.0–5.0 was absent from final reconciled findings; the 7.0–10.0 freeze remained. `TITLE_LENGTH_RECOMMENDATION` supplied the deliberate package warning.
- Actual installed CLI human scan — completed with `NEEDS_REVIEW`, 9 pass / 5 warn / 0 fail, and exit code 1.
- Actual installed CLI JSON scan — emitted JSON-only stdout, parsed successfully, reported the same verdict/counts, and returned exit code 1.
- Actual installed CLI clean scan — emitted a `READY` JSON report with 14 passed checks and returned exit code 0.
- Actual installed CLI missing-input scan — wrote a structured error to stderr, left JSON stdout empty, and returned exit code 2.
- Unified FastAPI scan test returned a schema-valid `PreflightReport`; the Milestone 1 inspection endpoint tests remain passing.
- `cd frontend && npm test` — 1 test file passed; 10 tests passed, 0 failed. Covered disabled scan action, verdict/count rendering, typed findings, category filtering, global findings, timestamp formatting, click-to-seek, READY, BLOCKED, runtime ERROR, and long-content resilience.
- `cd frontend && npm run build` — passed; `tsc -b` compiled cleanly and Vite 8.2.2 produced the production bundle (1,825 modules transformed).
- `cd frontend && npm run` — confirmed there is no separate lint or formatting command configured; TypeScript checking is part of the production build.
- In-app browser visual QA at 1440px — inspected new scan, selected-video, named-stage processing, NEEDS_REVIEW, READY, BLOCKED, and application ERROR states using a locally generated 12-second synthetic video. No browser console warnings or errors were observed.
- In-app browser responsive QA at 1024px and 430px — no document-level horizontal overflow; the 1024px results workspace retained its two-column inspection/evidence layout, and the narrow results and form layouts stacked into 398px-wide columns within the 430px viewport.
- Browser interaction QA — Audio filtering reduced the rendered findings from 5 to 2; timeline markers were positioned at 16.6667%, 25%, and 58.3333% for the 2s, 3s, and 7s events in a 12-second report; marker and timecode actions sought the selected HTML5 video to 2s and 7s respectively; timeline hover revealed title plus interval; keyboard focus styling was visible.
- Milestone 4.1 `cd frontend && npm test` — 1 test file passed; 11 tests passed, 0 failed. Existing behavioral coverage remains intact and now explicitly covers both finding-timecode and timeline-marker seek paths.
- Milestone 4.1 `cd frontend && npm run build` — passed; `tsc -b` compiled cleanly and Vite 8.2.2 transformed 1,825 modules.
- Milestone 4.1 `git diff --check` — passed. No separate lint or formatting command is configured.
- Milestone 4.1 visual-language audit — source search found no gradients, glows, box shadows, backdrop filters, background grids, decorative eyebrow labels, or visible mock-preview labels.
- Milestone 4.1 in-app browser QA at 1440px, 1280px, 1024px, and 430px — input, selected-file, processing, NEEDS_REVIEW, READY, BLOCKED, and runtime ERROR states inspected at normal browser zoom. No document-level horizontal overflow or browser console warnings/errors were observed.
- Milestone 4.1 results QA — video occupied approximately 63.6% of the desktop work surface at 1440px; metadata rendered as one line; the 14-check list remained collapsed by default; findings rendered as divider-separated review rows; the result and input columns stacked at 392px within the 430px viewport.
- Milestone 4.1 interaction QA — category filtering reduced 5 findings to 2 Audio findings; timeline markers remained at 16.6667%, 25%, and 58.3333%; finding and marker actions sought to 2s and 7s; hover/focus detail remained visible; check and technical-evidence disclosures expanded correctly.
- Milestone 5 `.venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests` — 70 passed, 0 failed, with 1 upstream Starlette `TestClient` deprecation warning; all Milestone 1–3 tests remain passing.
- Milestone 5 `cd frontend && npm test` — 2 test files passed; 20 tests passed, 0 failed. Coverage includes exact multipart fields and optional captions, preserved description line breaks, runtime response validation, READY/NEEDS_REVIEW/BLOCKED handling, structured and network errors, intentional aborts, reset/retry, repeated scans, local seeking, and proof that production scanning has no mock timer/report dependency.
- Milestone 5 `cd frontend && npm run build` — passed; `tsc -b` compiled cleanly and Vite 8.2.2 produced the production bundle. No separate lint or formatting script is configured.
- Fresh 1280×720 deterministic anomaly fixture generated locally and submitted through the running FastAPI endpoint using multipart `file`, `title`, and `description` fields — HTTP 200 in approximately 0.384 seconds; report-recorded scan runtime approximately 0.366 seconds.
- Real endpoint report — `NEEDS_REVIEW`; 14 checks run, 9 passed, 5 warnings, 0 critical. Black expected 2.0–5.0 → 2.0–5.0; silence expected 3.0–6.0 → 3.0–6.000021; non-black freeze expected 7.0–10.0 → 7.0–10.0. `TITLE_LENGTH_RECOMMENDATION` supplied the package warning.
- Real endpoint reconciliation — the final report contained only the non-black 7.0–10.0 freeze; no redundant freeze appeared inside the black 2.0–5.0 interval. The response passed the frontend client's full runtime contract validation.
- In-app browser real integration smoke — selected and uploaded the deterministic video, observed only the truthful indeterminate processing state, rendered the real 1280×720 9/5/0 report, and found no browser console warnings/errors.
- Browser interaction smoke — real marker positions were 16.6667%, 25%, and 58.3333%; the black finding sought the local video to 2 seconds and the freeze timeline marker sought it to 7 seconds.
- Browser lifecycle/error smoke — New scan removed the prior report; a real malformed upload rendered the structured invalid-media error rather than BLOCKED; Return preserved form data for retry; replacing the file and rescanning produced a fresh 10-passed/4-warning report without the prior title warning or stale error.
- Backend temporary-upload cleanup check — no `creator-preflight-*` request directories remained after successful and invalid-media requests.
- Milestone 6 `.venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests` — 102 passed, 0 failed, with 1 upstream Starlette `TestClient` deprecation warning. Existing Milestone 1–5 tests remain passing.
- Milestone 6 `cd frontend && npm test` — 2 test files passed; 23 tests passed, 0 failed. Caption category rendering, timestamp seeking, global finding timeline exclusion, non-null caption-summary contract validation, and all prior integration behavior are covered.
- Milestone 6 `cd frontend && npm run build` — passed; TypeScript compiled cleanly and Vite produced the production bundle. `git diff --check` passed; no separate lint command is configured.
- Actual installed CLI with fresh deterministic video plus valid SRT — `NEEDS_REVIEW`; 20 checks, 16 passed, 4 existing media warnings, 0 critical; 4 cues, 12.0 seconds merged coverage, 100% timeline coverage; JSON parsed cleanly; exit code 1 correctly represented a completed warning scan. Report runtime was approximately 0.479 seconds and wall time 0.702 seconds.
- Actual CLI malformed-SRT scan — completed as `NEEDS_REVIEW` rather than crashing; 15 checks, 10 passed, 6 warnings, 0 critical, including `CAPTION_PARSE_ERROR` and `CAPTION_EMPTY`; human output rendered both caption findings.
- Live FastAPI multipart WebVTT upload — HTTP 200 in approximately 0.510 seconds; report runtime 0.492 seconds; `NEEDS_REVIEW`, 20 checks, 16 passed, 4 existing media warnings, 0 critical; 3 parsed cues and 100% merged timeline coverage.
- Live FastAPI malformed-caption upload — HTTP 200 in approximately 0.446 seconds; report runtime 0.438 seconds; 15 checks, 10 passed, 6 warnings, 0 critical; returned structured caption findings and a zero-cue summary. No request temporary directories remained after valid or malformed uploads.
- Speech/caption comparison tests cover fully covered speech, uncovered speech, partial coverage, boundary tolerance, no speech, no captions, adjacent uncovered-segment merging, optional-disabled behavior, unavailable dependency/model behavior, transcription failure, model reuse, and mocked successful scanner integration.
- Actual optional-transcription unavailable smoke with `transcription.enabled: true` and no installed optional dependency — the core scan completed `NEEDS_REVIEW` with a `CAPTION_TRANSCRIPTION_UNAVAILABLE` finding and `reason_code: transcription_dependency_unavailable`.
- Milestone 7.5 `.venv/bin/python -m pip install './backend[transcription]'` — succeeded; installed `faster-whisper` 1.2.1 and its existing optional dependency set.
- Milestone 7.5 real local transcription smoke — downloaded one `Systran/faster-whisper-tiny.en` model (approximately 75 MB) into a temporary cache, then reloaded it with `local_files_only: true`. A temporary 8-second mono WAV was created with macOS `say` from “Creator Preflight checks videos before publishing.” The existing `WhisperTranscriber` returned one segment at 0.0–7.0 seconds with text “Create or pre-flight checks videos before publishing.”
- Milestone 7.5 real speech/caption comparison — applying one temporary caption cue at 0.0–1.0 seconds to that real speech segment produced `CAPTION_SPEECH_GAP` at 1.3–7.0 seconds after the configured 0.3-second boundary tolerance.
- Milestone 7.5 `.venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests/test_transcription.py backend/tests/test_captions.py` — 21 passed, 0 failed. This includes a real baseline media scan proving disabled transcription does not invoke the optional adapter.
- Milestone 7.5 default-configuration assertion — confirmed transcription remains disabled, downloads remain disabled with `local_files_only: true`, and defaults remain `tiny.en`, CPU, and `int8`. No production code, model weights, or generated speech fixture was added to the repository.
- Deterministic SRT parsing averaged approximately 0.0205 ms per four-cue file over 1,000 local iterations; caption parsing added negligible time relative to FFmpeg analysis.
- Milestone 7 `.venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests` — 103 passed, 0 failed, with 1 upstream Starlette `TestClient` deprecation warning. All earlier media, detector, rules, report, caption, CLI, and API behavior remains covered.
- Milestone 7 `cd frontend && npm test` — 2 test files passed; 24 tests passed, 0 failed. The lifecycle coverage now proves a deliberately non-cooperative stale request cannot overwrite a newer result, a failed request can retry successfully, removed native file inputs are cleared, and the preview object URL is revoked.
- Milestone 7 `cd frontend && npm run build` — passed; TypeScript compiled cleanly and Vite transformed 1,825 modules. `git diff --check` passed; no separate lint command is configured.
- Fresh full anomaly scan with valid four-cue SRT and a 108-character title — `NEEDS_REVIEW`; 20 checks, 15 passed, 5 warnings, 0 critical; black 2.0–5.0, silence 3.0–6.000021, non-black freeze 7.0–10.0, no black-overlap freeze, 100% merged caption coverage, and one title-length package warning. Live API runtime was approximately 0.448 seconds and HTTP time 0.463 seconds.
- Repeated identical anomaly scans produced the same ordered finding signature and internally consistent check/finding counts. Malformed captions now produce only `CAPTION_PARSE_ERROR`, with 15 checks, 14 passed, 1 warning, and no duplicate `CAPTION_EMPTY` on an otherwise clean fixture.
- Fresh clean 1280×720 one-second audiovisual fixture — `READY`; 14 checks, 14 passed, 0 warnings, 0 critical; runtime approximately 0.207 seconds.
- Media edge audit — live zero-byte and corrupt uploads returned structured HTTP 400 errors without tracebacks; a 0.08-second file with spaces and Unicode in its name scanned `READY`; a Unicode/spaced video without audio returned only `AUDIO_STREAM_MISSING` and `NEEDS_REVIEW`.
- Package/caption audit — exercised empty/long titles, empty descriptions, valid and malformed URLs, absent/malformed/backward/duplicate/out-of-range chapters, absent/valid/malformed/empty/out-of-range/overlapping/oversized SRT and WebVTT through the complete test suite and real smoke paths.
- CLI release audit — READY returned 0 with JSON-only stdout, findings returned 1 with JSON-only stdout, invalid configuration and missing FFprobe returned 2 with empty stdout and concise stderr. Missing FFmpeg produced the structured `media_tool_unavailable` application error.
- Resource/safety audit — no request temporary directories remained after successful, zero-byte, or corrupt live API requests; FFmpeg/FFprobe calls use argument arrays, captured output, and timeouts with no `shell=True`; normal scans contain no external network call; optional Whisper remains disabled and `local_files_only` by default.
- Milestone 8 `./scripts/run_demo.sh` from a clean generated-output state — succeeded; generated the 1280×720, 12-second synthetic demo and completed the installed CLI scan. The wrapper correctly treated the CLI's findings exit code 1 as a successful expected demo result.
- Milestone 8 direct documented CLI JSON scan — valid JSON-only stdout and exit code 1; `NEEDS_REVIEW`, 20 checks run, 15 passed, 5 warnings, and 0 critical. Black detected at 2.0–5.0 seconds, silence at 3.0–6.000021, and the non-black freeze at 7.0–10.0; the redundant black-overlap freeze remained reconciled. Global findings were `AUDIO_PEAK_WARNING` and the deliberately produced `TITLE_LENGTH_RECOMMENDATION`.
- Milestone 8 caption result — four valid SRT cues, first cue at 0.0 seconds, last cue ending at 12.0 seconds, 12.0 seconds merged coverage, 100% timeline coverage, and no caption findings. Measured report scan duration was approximately 0.442 seconds.
- Milestone 8 `.venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests` — 103 passed, 0 failed, with 1 upstream Starlette `TestClient` deprecation warning. Backend tests generate anomaly fixtures through the same reusable implementation as the demo.
- Milestone 8 `cd frontend && npm test` — 2 test files passed; 24 tests passed, 0 failed.
- Milestone 8 `cd frontend && npm run build` — passed; TypeScript compiled cleanly and Vite 8.2.2 transformed 1,825 modules.
- Milestone 9 README setup audit — `python3 -m venv .venv`, `.venv/bin/python -m pip install './backend[dev]'`, `cd frontend && npm install`, the documented FastAPI command, and the documented Vite command all succeeded. The backend and frontend served on `127.0.0.1:8000` and `127.0.0.1:5173`; the real scan request returned HTTP 200.
- Milestone 9 fresh `./scripts/run_demo.sh` — succeeded after moving the prior ignored output aside; regenerated the 1280×720 demo and reported `NEEDS_REVIEW`, 15 passed, 5 warnings, and 0 critical. Findings were black 2.0–5.0 seconds, silence 3.0–6.0 seconds, freeze 7.0–10.0 seconds, global audio peak, and title length.
- Milestone 9 live browser scan — rendered the real `creator-preflight-demo.mp4` report with 15 passed, 5 warnings, and 0 critical; four valid caption cues introduced no caption findings. Finding actions sought the local preview to exactly 2, 3, and 7 seconds. Timeline markers were positioned at 16.6667%, 25%, and 58.3333%; neither global finding received a marker. New scan cleared the report, files, title, and description; no visible mock/development selector or browser console warning/error was present.
- Milestone 9 visual audit at 100% browser zoom and 1280×720 viewport — no document-level horizontal overflow, clipped normal content, off-screen elements, broken timeline, development-only text, or dark-theme remnants were reproduced. No UI change was warranted.
- Milestone 9 repository audit — no tracked generated media, Whisper weights/cache, Python/Node caches, build output, `.env`/credential file, secret-pattern value, stale screenshot, huge binary, `/Users/` path, debug logging, unfinished core TODO, or production mock import was found. Generated demo output and routine caches remained ignored.
- Milestone 9 `.venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests` — 103 passed, 0 failed, with 1 upstream Starlette `TestClient` deprecation warning.
- Milestone 9 `cd frontend && npm test` — 2 test files passed; 24 tests passed, 0 failed.
- Milestone 9 `cd frontend && npm run build` — passed; TypeScript compiled cleanly and Vite 8.2.2 transformed 1,825 modules.
- Milestone 9 `.venv/bin/python -m compileall -q backend/src scripts`, `sh -n scripts/run_demo.sh`, and `git diff --check` — all passed.
- Milestone 10 baseline professional-video reproduction — the local 1280×720 H.264/AAC, approximately 9:50 creator video initially returned `BLOCKED` with only `DESCRIPTION_REQUIRED` as critical and `AUDIO_PEAK_WARNING` from a decoded maximum of -0.0 dBFS. It had no black, silence, or freeze findings.
- Milestone 10 audio investigation — the professional video had 39,809 samples in `volumedetect`'s top 1 dBFS bin out of 52,045,824 decoded samples (approximately 0.0765%), demonstrating that its isolated full-scale peak was not sustained. The calibrated default requires at least 5% near-full-scale sample density in addition to the existing -1.0 dBFS peak threshold.
- Milestone 10 professional-video rerun with a normal title and non-empty description — `READY`; 14 checks run, 14 passed, 0 warnings, 0 critical, and no black, silence, freeze, or audio findings; report runtime approximately 15.546 seconds.
- Milestone 10 representative controls — ordinary moving video, a low-motion talking-head proxy, normal speech-like pauses over continuous ambient noise, a 0.5-second black transition, a brief near-full-scale transient, and a clean audiovisual control produced no inappropriate black, silence, freeze, or audio warnings under the unchanged black/silence/freeze defaults.
- Milestone 10 fresh `./scripts/run_demo.sh` — succeeded; `NEEDS_REVIEW`, 20 checks run, 15 passed, 5 warnings, 0 critical. Black was detected at 2.0–5.0 seconds, silence at 3.0–6.000021, and the non-black freeze at 7.0–10.0; the black-overlap freeze remained reconciled. The deliberately hard-limited audio interval produced a global density warning with 37,706 of 576,512 decoded samples (approximately 6.54%) in the top 1 dBFS bin, and the intended title-length warning remained.
- Milestone 10 clean 1280×720 three-second audiovisual control — `READY`; 14 checks run, 14 passed, 0 warnings, 0 critical; report runtime approximately 0.182 seconds.
- Milestone 10 missing-description-only validation on the clean control — `NEEDS_REVIEW`; 14 checks run, 13 passed, 1 warning, 0 critical; the sole finding was `DESCRIPTION_REQUIRED` with warning severity, and CLI exit code 1 represented a completed review scan.
- Milestone 10 `.venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests` — 109 passed, 0 failed, with 1 upstream Starlette `TestClient` deprecation warning.
- Milestone 10 `cd frontend && npm test -- --run` — 2 test files passed; 24 tests passed, 0 failed.
- Milestone 10 `cd frontend && npm run build` — passed; TypeScript compiled cleanly and Vite 8.2.2 transformed 1,825 modules.
- Milestone 10 `.venv/bin/python -m compileall -q backend/src scripts`, `sh -n scripts/run_demo.sh`, and `git diff --check` — all passed.
- Milestone 11 official API verification — current Google documentation identifies stable `gemini-3.7-flash` as accepting video input and supporting structured output; installed `google-genai` 2.22.0 exposes Files upload/get/delete, bounded HTTP options, and `models.generate_content` with native response schema support.
- Milestone 11 optional installation — `.venv/bin/python -m pip install './backend[dev,ai]'` succeeded. The ordinary dependency set remains unchanged unless the `ai` extra is explicitly selected.
- Milestone 11 targeted AI/config/report/API/CLI validation — 59 passed, 0 failed, with 1 upstream Starlette `TestClient` deprecation warning.
- Milestone 11 `.venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests` — 127 passed, 0 failed, with 1 upstream Starlette `TestClient` deprecation warning. Tests use injected provider clients and make no live Gemini request.
- Milestone 11 `cd frontend && npm test -- --run` — 2 test files passed; 25 tests passed, 0 failed. AI-sourced findings use the existing findings/filter/timeline contract.
- Milestone 11 `cd frontend && npm run build` — passed; TypeScript compiled cleanly and Vite 8.2.2 transformed 1,825 modules.
- Generated AI smoke fixture — 640×360, 12.0 seconds, 291,459 bytes; blue/left-box/330 Hz from 0–4 seconds, green/center-box/440 Hz from 4–8 seconds, and red/right-box/550 Hz from 8–12 seconds.
- Real AI-unavailable scan with `ai_review.enabled: true` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` intentionally absent — deterministic scan completed `NEEDS_REVIEW`; 15 checks, 14 passed, 1 warning, 0 critical; `AI_REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE` was the sole finding and report provenance recorded `ai_api_key_missing` without invoking Gemini.
- AI-disabled clean scan — `READY`; schema 1.1, 14 checks, 14 passed, 0 warnings, 0 critical, `ai_review.status: disabled`, and no provider invocation.
- Missing-description regression — `NEEDS_REVIEW`, 1 warning, 0 critical, with AI disabled. Fresh `./scripts/run_demo.sh` retained 15 passed, 5 warnings, 0 critical and the accepted 2–5 second black, 3–6 second silence, and 7–10 second freeze results.
- Initial live-provider attempts exposed a narrow endpoint defect: Files processing first returned a transient provider HTTP 500, and the Interactions generation path then exhausted its 180-second read timeout. The adapter was changed only at the generation boundary to the maintained SDK's `models.generate_content` Files API path, with native JSON schema, low thinking, automatic function calling disabled, and the same bounded timeout.
- Successful real Gemini smoke — `google-genai` 2.22.0 with `gemini-3.7-flash` authenticated, uploaded the 12.0-second/291,459-byte generated video, reached active processing, returned three schema-valid observations, and explicitly deleted the remote file. Upload took approximately 1.451 seconds, provider processing 2.228 seconds, generation 7.219 seconds, and total adapter time 11.224 seconds.
- Real observations — blue background/white square left at 0.0–3.5 seconds, green background/white square centered at 3.5–7.5 seconds, and reddish-brown background/white square right at 7.5–11.0 seconds; all three returned 0.99 confidence and matched the known 0–4, 4–8, and 8–12 second fixture states within expected sampling tolerance.
- The exact real observation payload passed the production Pydantic trust boundary, media-duration validation, and finding normalizer, producing three review-only `AI_REVIEW_VISUAL_CHANGE` findings with `ai.gemini` provenance and the same numeric intervals.
- A subsequent full-scanner live request encountered a provider generation failure and correctly returned a schema-valid non-blocking `AI_REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE` result, demonstrating the real fallback path. The missing-key regression separately remained `NEEDS_REVIEW` with one AI-unavailable warning, zero critical findings, and no fabricated observations.
- Milestone 11 continuation `PYTHONPATH=backend/src .venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests/test_ai_review.py` — 15 passed, 0 failed after the live endpoint correction.
- Milestone 11 continuation complete backend suite — 127 passed, 0 failed, with 1 upstream Starlette `TestClient` deprecation warning.
- Milestone 11 continuation frontend suite — 2 files and 25 tests passed; the production TypeScript/Vite build passed with 1,825 modules transformed.
- Milestone 11 continuation deterministic release gate — clean control remained `READY` with no findings and AI disabled; missing description remained `NEEDS_REVIEW` with zero critical findings; the anomaly demo retained 15 passed, 5 warnings, black 2–5 seconds, silence 3–6 seconds, freeze 7–10 seconds, and calibrated near-full-scale audio behavior.
- Milestone 11 continuation `.venv/bin/python -m compileall -q backend/src scripts` and `git diff --check` — passed. `.env.local` remained ignored and untracked; diff-level secret, generated-fixture tracking, and repository hygiene checks passed without exposing credential contents.
- Milestone 11 `.venv/bin/python -m compileall -q backend/src scripts` and `git diff --check` — passed. Diff secret-pattern and tracked-artifact checks found no API key, `.env.local`, generated Gemini video, remote file identifier, or provider cache staged/tracked.
- Milestone 12 focused backend validation — 42 Promise/AI/API tests passed, 0 failed; frontend validation reached 28 tests passed, 0 failed, and the TypeScript/Vite production build passed.
- Real aligned Promise Check — generated 36.0-second video plus aligned PNG; Gemini inferred “An explanation of how and why blue light exposure disrupts sleep patterns,” found substantive delivery at 12.0 seconds, marked title and thumbnail aligned at 0.70 confidence, emitted zero Promise findings, and cleaned up the remote file. Upload 1.618s, processing 2.238s, generation 10.646s, total AI 14.894s.
- Real mismatched-title Promise Check — title “How to Bake Sourdough Bread at Home” against the blue-light video produced `AI_TITLE_CONTENT_MISMATCH` at 0.0–36.0 seconds with direct on-screen evidence and 0.99 confidence; final result `NEEDS_REVIEW`, 14 passed, 1 warning, 0 critical. Upload 1.691s, processing 2.244s, generation 10.371s, total AI 14.718s. One intervening transient provider generation failure exercised the non-blocking unavailable path before the successful conservative retry.
- Optional professional-video Promise Check — the local approximately 9:50 Dasani creator video returned `READY`; inferred promise was an explanation of why Dasani failed and left the UK, substantive delivery began at 16.5 seconds, overall delivery was aligned at 0.85 confidence, and no findings were emitted. Upload 78.383s, processing 20.991s, generation 29.080s, total AI 128.911s; explicit cleanup succeeded.
- M11 shared-provider regression after task generalization — the 12-second smoke video again returned the three expected 0.0–3.5, 3.5–7.5, and 7.5–11.0 visual observations at 0.99 confidence; total AI time 10.820s and cleanup succeeded.
- Milestone 12 deterministic regression — clean control `READY` (14/14 passed); missing-description-only `NEEDS_REVIEW` (13 passed, 1 warning, 0 critical); missing-key Promise path `NEEDS_REVIEW` with only `AI_REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE`; one-command anomaly demo retained 15 passed, 5 warnings, 0 critical and the established 2–5 black, 3–6 silence, 7–10 freeze, calibrated audio, and title findings.
- Milestone 12 complete backend suite — 146 passed, 0 failed, with 1 upstream Starlette TestClient deprecation warning. Complete frontend suite — 2 files and 28 tests passed, 0 failed. TypeScript compilation and Vite production build passed with 1,825 modules transformed.
- Milestone 12 `.venv/bin/python -m compileall -q backend/src scripts`, `sh -n scripts/run_demo.sh`, and `git diff --check` — passed. `.env.local` remained ignored/untracked, generated Promise media remained ignored, and the diff-level API-key pattern check found no credential.
- Milestone 13 controlled fixtures — clean: 45.0 seconds / 1,988,190 bytes; problematic: 48.0 seconds / 2,204,790 bytes. Both deterministic scans were `READY` with 14/14 checks and no technical findings.
- Milestone 13 live clean Viewer task — `gemini-3.7-flash` returned `clean`, summary “No visual-narration conflicts, unrendered placeholder text, or duplicate segment sequences were observed in the video,” zero issues, and successful remote cleanup.
- Milestone 13 live problematic Viewer task — upload 2.277s, processing 2.204s, generation 5.119s, total 9.599s, cleanup succeeded. It returned conflict 0.0–4.0s at 0.76 confidence (spoken `2021`, visible `2020`), placeholder 12.0–23.0s at 0.78 (`TODO REPLACE THIS CHART`), and duplicated ending 36.0–48.0s versus original 24.0–36.0s at 0.77. The calibrated 0.75 evidence gate normalizes all three as review-only findings.
- The first provisional 0.80 Viewer gate suppressed these unmistakable controlled observations; the default was calibrated to 0.75 while retaining per-type evidence requirements and low-confidence suppression.
- Full shared-session live retries uploaded and cleaned the video once, but the provider returned its account request-quota error before a successful Promise + Viewer pair could complete. The observed 429 is now mapped to safe non-blocking `ai_provider_quota_exhausted` state.
- Milestone 13 focused backend suite — 62 passed, 0 failed, with 1 upstream Starlette TestClient deprecation warning. Complete backend suite — 156 passed, 0 failed, with the same warning.
- Milestone 13 frontend suite — 2 files and 30 tests passed, 0 failed. TypeScript compilation and Vite production build passed with 1,825 modules transformed.
- Milestone 13 deterministic release regression — clean narrated control `READY` (14 passed, 0 warnings); missing description `NEEDS_REVIEW` (13 passed, 1 warning, 0 critical); anomaly demo retained 15 passed, 5 warnings, black 2–5s, silence 3–6s, freeze 7–10s, calibrated audio, and title warning.
- Milestone 13 final live full-production acceptance — the 48-second problematic control completed in approximately 13.616 seconds with `NEEDS_REVIEW`, 16 checks run, 15 passed, 3 warnings, and 0 critical. One Gemini Files upload (2.229s) was shared by two generation calls: Promise Check (3.350s) and Final Viewer Pass (4.938s). Provider processing used two polls totaling approximately 0.234s; one explicit remote deletion completed in 0.436s.
- The combined live report contained both validated task results. Promise Check was `aligned` at 0.72 confidence, inferred “An explanation and update on the launch and status of the Aurora Project,” and found substantive delivery at 0.0s. Final Viewer Pass returned three review-only findings: narration `2021` versus visible `2020` at 0.0–4.0s (0.85), visible `TODO REPLACE THIS CHART` at 12.0–24.0s (0.88), and duplicated closing segment at 36.0–48.0s versus original 24.0–36.0s (0.87). AI provenance reported `succeeded`, cleanup true, and no AI result produced `BLOCKED`.
- Milestone 14 targeted backend validation — 58 passed, 0 failed, with 1 upstream Starlette TestClient deprecation warning. Complete backend suite — 166 passed, 0 failed, with the same warning.
- Milestone 14 frontend suite — 2 files and 31 tests passed, 0 failed. TypeScript compilation and Vite production build passed with 1,825 modules transformed.
- Milestone 14 fixture generation — 36.016-second, 1,609,053-byte local narrated fixture generated successfully; it remains ignored and untracked.
- Milestone 14 first live attempt after network authorization — Gemini extracted Eiffel Tower/1889 and Apollo 11/1968, ignored the subjective spacecraft statement, and returned correct grounded conclusions, but the response included no usable citation metadata. The trust boundary correctly downgraded both results to `insufficient_evidence` and emitted no warning.
- Structured JSON grounding can omit usable per-field support spans even when request-level citation chunks exist. The citation normalizer now retains only those real provider chunks as batched evidence in that case; it still never trusts model-authored URLs, and no citations still means `insufficient_evidence`. A focused regression test covers this behavior.
- Milestone 14 corrective live acceptance — the 36.016-second/1,609,053-byte fixture completed `NEEDS_REVIEW` with 17 checks, 16 passed, 1 warning, and 0 critical. Gemini extracted Eiffel Tower/1889 at 0.0s (0.99) and Apollo 11/1968 at 12.0s (0.98), ignored the subjective statement, grounded Eiffel as `supported` (1.0), and grounded Apollo as `possible_conflict` (1.0) with the July 20, 1969 evidence.
- Real grounding metadata supplied Eiffel citations titled `wikipedia.org` and `britannica.com`, and Apollo citations titled `wikipedia.org` and `usra.edu`, each as a provider-issued Google grounding redirect URL. Only Apollo produced `AI_CLAIM_POSSIBLE_CONFLICT`, timestamped at 12.0s; the supported Eiffel claim produced no finding.
- The accepted live scan used one client, one Files API upload, four total generation calls (Promise, Viewer, Claim extraction, one batched Search verification), and one remote deletion. Upload took 2.265s, provider-state retrieval 0.218s, Claim extraction 2.542s, grounded verification 2.962s, cleanup 0.412s, and the full scan 22.825s. AI provenance recorded `succeeded` and cleanup true.
- Milestone 14 post-live targeted Claim Review suite — 11 passed, 0 failed. `git diff --check` passed; `.env.local` and generated media remained ignored and untracked.
