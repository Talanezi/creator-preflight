# Scripts

- `generate_demo_fixture.py` creates the deterministic, copyright-free 12-second demo video used by the primary release workflow.
- `run_demo.sh` generates that video and scans it with the tracked demo title, description, and SRT package.
- `generate_promise_fixture.py` creates the ignored 36-second semantic Promise Check video and aligned PNG thumbnail used for local Gemini validation.
- `generate_viewer_fixture.py` creates ignored clean and deliberately inconsistent narrated Final Viewer Pass videos. It uses FFmpeg plus the local macOS `say` command; automated tests do not depend on that platform-specific speech generator.
- `generate_claim_fixture.py` creates the ignored 36-second narrated Claim Review fixture with one supported fact, one conflicting date, and one subjective statement. It uses FFmpeg plus the local macOS `say` command.

Run both from the repository root. See the root `README.md` and `demo/README.md` for prerequisites, exact commands, and expected findings.
